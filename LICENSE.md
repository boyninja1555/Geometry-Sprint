Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies  
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

## Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for  
software and other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed  
to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast,  
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to  
share and change all versions of a program—to make sure it remains free  
software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the  
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to  
any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to  
your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not  
price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you  
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for  
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you  
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new  
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you  
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have  
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if  
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether  
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same  
freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive  
or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they  
know their rights.

Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:  
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License  
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

For the developers’ and authors’ protection, the GPL clearly explains  
that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users’ and  
authors’ sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as  
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to  
authors of previous versions.

Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run  
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer  
can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of  
protecting users’ freedom to change the software. The systematic  
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to  
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we  
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those  
products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we  
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions  
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.  
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of  
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to  
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could  
make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that  
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and  
modification follow.

## Terms and Conditions

### 1. Definitions

- **This License** refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.  
- **Copyright** also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.  
- **The Program** refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as **you**. **Licensees** and **recipients** may be individuals or organizations.  
- To **modify** a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than making an exact copy. The resulting work is called a **modified version** or a work **based on** the earlier work.  
- A **covered work** means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.  
- To **propagate** means any activity that, without permission, would make you liable for infringement, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy.  
- To **convey** means any form of propagation enabling other parties to make or receive copies.  
- **Appropriate Legal Notices** are prominently visible interface features that (1) display copyright and no-warranty notices and (2) explain the recipient’s rights under this License.

### 2. Source Code

The **source code** for a work means the preferred form of the work  
for making modifications to it. **Object code** means any non-source  
form of a work.

A **Standard Interface** means an interface that is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of language-specific interfaces, one widely used among developers.  

The **System Libraries** of an executable work include anything, other  
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in normal packaging of a Major Component but is not part of it, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component or to implement a Standard Interface. A **Major Component** means a major essential part (kernel, window system, etc.) of the operating system, compiler, or interpreter on which the work runs.

The **Corresponding Source** for object code includes all source code needed to generate, install, run, and modify the work, excluding System Libraries and general-purpose tools not part of the work.

### 3. Basic Permissions

All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of  
copyright on the Program, and are **irrevocable** provided the stated  
conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your **unlimited permission** to run the unmodified Program.  
- You may make, run, and propagate covered works that you do **not** convey.  
- You may convey covered works to others to modify exclusively for you, provided they do so under your direction and control.  
- **Sublicensing** is not allowed.

### 4. Protecting Users’ Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law

> No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under applicable anti-circumvention laws.

When you convey a covered work, you **waive** any legal power to forbid circumvention of protections to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License.

### 5. Conveying Verbatim Copies

You may convey verbatim copies of the Program’s source code as you  
receive it, provided that you:  
1. Publish an **appropriate copyright notice**;  
2. **Keep intact** all license and warranty notices;  
3. Provide recipients with a copy of this License.

You may charge any price or no price for each copy.

### 6. Conveying Modified Source Versions

You may convey a work based on the Program in source form if you:  
a. Include **prominent notices** of modification and date.  
b. State that the work is released under this License.  
c. License the entire work under this License.  
d. Ensure interactive interfaces display **Appropriate Legal Notices** if the original did.

An **aggregate** of separate works does not cause this License to apply to the other parts.

### 7. Conveying Non-Source Forms

You may convey object code under sections 5 and 6 if you also provide the Corresponding Source by:  
1. Physical medium with source.  
2. Written offer valid ≥3 years for source.  
3. Occasional noncommercial copies with offer.  
4. Network server access to both.

For **User Products**, you must also provide **Installation Information** to install modified object code.

### 8. Additional Terms

**Additional permissions** may supplement this License; you may remove them when conveying. If authorized, you may also add terms that disclaim warranty differently, preserve notices, prohibit misrepresentation, limit publicity uses, decline trademark rights, or require indemnification. Any **further restrictions** beyond these may be removed.

### 9. Termination

Your rights terminate automatically if you violate this License, but are reinstated provisionally upon cessation, and permanently if no notice within 60 days.

### 10. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies

Receiving or running a copy does not require acceptance. Propagation or modification does.

### 11. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients

Recipients automatically receive the original licensors’ license under this License. You may not add further restrictions.

### 12. Patents

Each **contributor** grants you a worldwide, royalty-free patent license under their essential patent claims to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import, and otherwise run, modify, and propagate their contributor version. If you rely on a patent license while conveying and the source is unavailable, you must make it available, relinquish the patent benefit, or extend the license downstream.

### 13. No Surrender of Others’ Freedom

If you face conditions that contradict this License, you may not convey the work at all.

### 14. Use with the GNU Affero GPL

You may link or combine a covered work with an AGPLv3-licensed work; this License applies to the covered part and the AGPL’s network provisions apply to the combination.

### 15. Revised Versions of this License

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised versions. If the Program permits “any later version,” you may follow later terms, which may grant more permissions but impose no new obligations on authors.

### 16. Disclaimer of Warranty

> THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  
> The Program is provided “as is,” without warranty of any kind.

### 17. Limitation of Liability

> IN NO EVENT will any copyright holder or other party be liable for any damages arising from use or inability to use the Program.
